# Task Board

## Description

- This task board project allows a user to create their own, personal list of tasks they need to do, are doing, or have completed. Each task has the name of the task, date to finish by, and a description of what the task is. Each of the tasks on the board are able to be dragged and dropped to a different column. The user will also be able to delete tasks they have created if desired. Tasks that are placed on the board are stored locally which means that a user's task will persist on opening the page and on page reload.

* This project was created to practice my bootstrap, jquery, and JavaScript knowledge. The possibility to drag and drop tasks and to choose a date from a date-time picker was all thanks to the use of jquery ui. The modal that pops up when a user presses "Add Task" is thanks to bootstrap.
